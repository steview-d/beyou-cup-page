Which is why you’ll find so many different options of period products available out there - we all have different needs and priorities when it comes to our comfort! Depending on your reasoning about making the switch, you’ll find that the menstrual cup has some of the best advantages:<br><ul><li>A menstrual cup produces less waste and is more environmentally friendly</li><li>Your BeYou cup is reusable and will save you loads of money in the long-term</li><li>Menstrual cups don’t contain toxic chemicals that affect your pH balance</li></ul><br>If you’re an avid-pad user then you know all about the fear of leaks and stains when your pad is feeling that slight-bit too full in a dire situation! By switching to a menstrual cup you’ll be saying goodbye to those terrible irritations of a pad and chafing from those wings! With your BeYou Menstrual Cup you can finally wear those sleek thongs at any time you want(although, you’re still more likely to find us on the couch, munching on chocolate)<br><br>Menstrual cups are extremely discreet and comfortable. You’ll find that because they’re inserted inside of you they’re less likely to shift or leak, thanks to the tight suction seal formed by the rim! You can wear a BeYou Menstrual Cup for up to 12 hours at a time, depending on how heavy your cycle is and what day of your flow you’re on. It is advisable to empty your cup every 4 hours, even if you can keep it in for a maximum of 12 hours - it’s always good to check in on your flow, as you never really know sometimes!<br><br>A menstrual cup won’t give off a strange smell, like the strong odours you get from a menstrual pad. This is just because the blood inside a menstrual cup isn’t exposed to as much air as it is on a pad."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Although a menstrual cup and tampon are inserted in a similar way, they way they both function is very different.<br><br>A tampon absorbs the liquid within your vagina, whereas the BeYou Menstrual Cup collects and holds the fluid, until you remove the cup. That’s why a menstrual cup is less likely to leak. Unlike a tampon, the BeYou cup is made from a super soft medical-grade silicone which protects the natural pH balance that won’t lead to vaginal dryness and doesn’t contain any toxic chemicals that could harm your body!<br><br>Because a tampon holds the moisture that is kept exposed within your vagina, you need to change your tampon every 4 hours maximum to avoid infection or irritation. With the suction seal formed with your cup, it’s safe to wear for up to 12 hours and holds more fluid than a tampon(Also why you’re less likely to leak!)<br><br>When it comes to environmental factors, you’ll know that tampons aren't recyclable for sanitary reasons, nor are they reusable either. Non-recyclable period products have a drastic effect on the environment. It may not be quite clear why at first, but think about how much waste that is when there are over  800 million women on their period at the same time, at any given day of the year. Think of just how much waste and pollution is saved(as well as money) when you can use one menstrual cup for a period of 10 years at a time!<br><br>Should you end up making a switch to the BeYou cup, you’ll probably find yourself asking why you haven’t done it sooner!"

After all, using a tampon for the first time definitely doesn’t come as second-nature, the first few times.<br><br>It’s the same as with any person on their period, no matter your age. It’s just about finding the position and fit favourable for you. So many women using a menstrual cup come back to us and tell us how much better they’ve gotten to know themselves and their bodies, and that is never a bad thing, no matter what age you start using a menstrual cup!<br><br>My advice would be: give yourself time to try different folds and positions and get used to the menstrual cup, just like you would do with a tampon or a sanitary pad. Your blood will help make inserting a period product smoother and gentler, so go ahead and make a ‘bloody mess’! It’s the one time you’ll want to!"

            A tampon absorbs the blood and the moisture within your vagina, which is why sometimes you end up feeling very dry. Especially towards the end of your period, you’ll notice that the dryness can cause uncomfortable friction.<br><br>
            
            Maintaining this moisture in your vagina is important, because that is where you get your healthy bacteria from which protects you from vaginal infections. A lot of the times a vaginal infection can be triggered by a lack of moisture in your vagina that is brought on by a tampon.<br><br>

            The menstrual cup can take a bit of time to adjust to, but for some it brings along major ease around that time of the month, while others would prefer starting with a tampon and then slowly making their way to a cup, once you’re feeling more comfortable with your body. Either way, it’s another option that you can consider and one that steps outside of the standards set so strictly by the status quo. That’s the beauty of choice: it’s yours to make :)"

            "text": "<strong>Pads</strong><br>
            Many people make the switch to a menstrual cup for the environment, in support of an eco-friendly lifestyle. Menstrual cups produce a substantially smaller amount of waste than sanitary pads do, as together, pads and tampons are responsible for around 200,000 tonnes of waste each year-mostly from plastic!<br><br>
            
            This is because pads are mostly made up of 90% of plastic, which doesn’t biodegrade and takes at least 500 years to decompose. The menstrual cup can be recycled and also saves you on purchasing any other period product for almost an entire decade, reducing the amount of single-use waste. Unlike the menstrual cup, when pads are incinerated they release toxic fumes, as well as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Tampons</strong><br>
            Nearly all tampons contain some sort of plastic, even if it’s not visible at first glance. You can find plastic in the strings, and just like a pad, a tampon takes hundreds of years to decompose.<br><br>
            
            Many are switching out tampons for menstrual cups because tampons have harsh toxins and chemicals that not only affect the environment but can also affect the natural balance of your pH levels in your vagina. The BeYou Menstrual Cup doesn’t contain any chemicals or nasties and is completely plastic-free, because it's made from medical-grade silicone.<br><br>

            Silicone can be recycled, but it might be a little tricky to find a facility at first that does recycle small quantities of silicone. You can contact your local recycling centre and find out if they will accept your menstrual cup.<br><br>
            
            A menstrual cup contains no harmful chemicals, so you can also cut it up into fine pieces and add it to the soil of a plant or in your garden, even plant a little plant IN your cup (a cute small one) or just burn it up into ash and it won’t release any toxic fumes. Burning it will take a bit of a leap though, as silicon can withstand heat of up to 500 degrees - so take caution and turn to using a wood stove or a bonfire."

            You’ll know from your doctor that putting any foreign object, such as a cup, in your vagina after having a baby can cause an infection and may not be safe. That’s why using a menstrual cup isn’t encouraged until you’ve received the all-clear from your doctor first.<br><br>
            
            You’ll need to give your body some time to convalesce, because your anatomy will be sore and swollen after giving birth, so that means no cups (and probably no sex either) until you have healed properly and been given the all-clear from your health care provider.<br><br>
            
            We’re no medical experts so don’t take our word for it and everyone is different, but your bleeding could start subsiding around 6 weeks of birth.

            Once you’ve been given the thumbs up, you’ll find that using a menstrual cup after having a baby can be a little different, if you’ve already used one before. There are a few things you may need to adjust to since you’ve given birth, such as possibly moving up to a larger cup size, as you may notice an increase in blood, as well as a shifted position of your cervix.<br><br>

            The endo community is highly involved here at BeYou, many of them loving the cup or showing an interest in wanting to make the switch to a BeYou menstrual cup. As our BeYou menstrual cup is much softer and holds more blood than a tampon, many women in the endo community found that the  BeYou menstrual cup is great support for those unexpected symptoms. You’ll find that you don’t need to empty the cup as much as you would have to with a tampon, also leading to less friction and irritation during this time and allowing you to monitor your menstrual flow.<br><br>
            
            When it comes to fibroids, you can wear a menstrual cup, but it’s quite dependent on your condition and we’d encourage you to consult with your doctor first. Depending on your circumstances, a fibroid tumor may get in the way for you to form that suction seal around the area of your cervix, which won’t keep the cup in place and will be rather pointless for you. That’s not to say you won’t be able to use a cup, it’s just to say that we can’t speak for everyone’s personal circumstances and it’s best to feel completely safe and reassured, if you’re thinking of making this switch.<br><br>
            
            If you’re diagnosed with adenomyosis, then you’ll already know that your condition can set off a heavy flow. If you’re thinking of switching to a menstrual cup, but you’re wanting to know how this will affect your condition with adenomyosis, the best answer is speak to your doctor about it. The menstrual cup is a great product if you’re experiencing heavy bleeding, because you can literally empty it out whenever you need to, without the risk of leaking! You won’t run out of sanitary products, you’ll just need your BeYou cup!<br><br>
            
            The BeYou cup is super soft and is often suitable if you have vaginismus. Using a water-based lube and our available medium-sized cups, you may find it’s a much more comfortable insertion experience. You may just require a bit more patience than usual, as the trick is to find the perfect spot that works for you, but this can be said for any menstrual cup user."

            If you’ve had the coil or IUD fitted for more than 3 months, before starting to use the menstrual cup, then there is less of a chance that your menstrual cup will interfere with your IUD. It’s more common for your IUD/IUS to be expelled naturally by your body within the first 3 months that it’s inserted and isn’t triggered by the cup, but instead that the IUD/IUS is expelled by your body during your cycle.<br><br>
            
            It can happen that an IUD or mirena coil is dislodged from using a menstrual cup, and that’s simply from personal experiences within your anatomy and comes down to the individual. If you’re breaking the seal of your cup, before removing it then there is nothing to worry about!<br><br>
            
            If you’re using a menstrual cup with your IUD, check for your strings after every period. This is a common practice, throughout having your coil, whether you’re using a cup or not. You also want to keep some space between your BeYou cup and your vaginal cervix, so if you feel that your cervix is quite low, you may want to consider other options that won’t interfere with your IUD/IUS<br><br>
            
            If you feel like your IUD has shifted or is causing you some discomfort or pain, consider getting checked by a doctor and start using additional contraceptive measures, like a condom to tread on the side of caution until you’re reassured of your IUD placement.

Once you’ve tried the menstrual cup for about 3 cycles long, you’ll have a better idea as to whether to cut the stem or not. You can always cut the stem more, so rather cut too little the beginning than too much.<br><br>

            The way your cervix shifts during your flow can affect how the cup will feel and fit for you, but there unfortunately isn’t a simple answer for everyone. Some cup users even use two different sized cups throughout their flow, one for lighter flow days and one for when you’re experiencing heavier bleeding. It’s entirely up to you!

            Even if you haven’t had any penetrative sex or masturbation, you can still wear the BeYou Menstrual Cup. If you’re worried about inserting the cup, the only difference is that you may feel some slight discomfort at first, which is why you may want to opt for a softer, smaller cup at first. This is why so many cup newbies love our BeYou cup, as it’s a lot softer than most cups you’ll find on the market!<br><br>
            
            If tearing your hymen doesn’t support your personal beliefs, culture or religious views, then you’ll probably want to stay away from any menstrual products that you have to place internally. All of these risk tearing your hymen, only because it’s such a thin membrane and can easily be torn."

            We love that we live in a world where everyone is different, which is why different menstrual cup sizes are available. There is a cup for everyone!<br><br>
            
            Many factors influence your choice of choosing your menstrual cup, starting with your cervix height, your personal preference and how your uterus is sitting in your body. This is why so many women find the cup liberating - it’s a great way to open up to yourself and get to know yourself that bit better, encouraging bodily empowerment.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Which size Menstrual Cup do I need?</strong><br>
            The size of your BeYou menstrual cup will come down to the following factors: your current age and whether you have experienced childbirth so far. You can take a look at our size chart below, for more guidance or just ask us what we might suggest!<br><br>
            
            <strong>What are the dimensions of the BeYou Menstrual Cups?</strong><br>
            The BeYou cup is one of the softest menstrual cups you can find on the market and it’s perfectly sized for first-time cup users. You can get the cup in a size medium or large depending on your personal preference.<br><br>
            
            <strong>How do I measure my cervix?</strong><br>
            If you haven’t heard of the ‘knuckle rule’ by now, prepare to be amazed! We couldn’t believe it either, that there had been this trick that we’d missed out the entire time!<br><br>
            
            You can use your knuckle to measure the different height of your cervix, throughout your period. This will help you decide how the cup will fit inside of you and may give you some clarity on any potential pain that you may have felt before. It’s simple, just stick a finger inside of you and see if you can feel your cervix. Your cervix may feel like a round ball or donut inside of your vagina. Once you’ve found your cervix, you can use our handy guide below to determine whether you have a low, average or high cervix, at the moment.<br><br>
            
            <strong>What is a low cervix?</strong><br>
            A low cervix is if your cervix is reachable near the vaginal opening and you can only get your finger to reach the first knuckle on your finger when measuring your cervix. Your cervix will shift throughout your cycle, so there is nothing ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ about the height of your cervix. You’ll find that with a lower cervix, you might find a softer cup more comfortable for you. A smaller size menstrual cup may also be preferable to help avoid additional pressure placed on you. There are many options available to you, it’s just all about finding out which one fits comfortably within you.<br><br>
            
            <strong>What is a high cervix?</strong><br>
            A higher cervix means that you can fit in all 3 knuckles of your finger into your vaginal space, before feeling your cervix. It’s likely that with a high cervix, you may not always be able to feel it, which means that just about any menstrual cup may be suitable for you. With a high cervix, you may want to look at getting a cup with a stem that you can use to remove the cup or it may be difficult to locate your cup at times. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Which Menstrual Cup should I buy if I have a low cervix?</strong><br>
            A lower cervix will probably mean that you may want to look at cups that aren’t too long and stems that won’t stick out or irritate your labia. You can always trim the stem of your cup if you like, but as for the size and shape of the cup it’s best to stay clear from rather large sizes.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Which Menstrual Cup should I buy if I have a high cervix?</strong><br>
            For a high cervix, you will need to think about how you feel the most comfortable in removing a cup. If you have a cup that is a smaller size, then you may need a longer stem to help you locate the menstrual cup. Or you can just opt for a larger size cup, if you find that more comfortable and easier when grabbing a hold of the base.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Which Menstrual Cup should I buy if I'm over 25 but have a small vagina?</strong><br>
            You can take a look at our size guide and measure your cervix to find the ideal BeYou cup size for you! If you’re still unsure, you can always check up with your gyno or pop us a message and we may be able to help!<br><br>
            
            <strong>Which Menstrual Cup should I buy if I'm over 25 but only use a medium tampon?</strong><br>
            Well, if you’re able to use tampons then you’re slightly more familiar with inserting something inside of you, so you should be fine with using a menstrual cup that fits in with our size guide. 
            When switching from tampons to the BeYou cup, try different positions, folds and make sure you’re comfortable when you’re experimenting with inserting your cup! But technically speaking, if a baby’s head can fit down there, then a menstrual cup will be fine for you! If you’re worried, you can use some water-based lube on the tip of the cup, to help. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Which Menstrual Cup should I buy if I'm over 25, have had children, but have only been able to use small tampons?</strong><br>
            You may want to consult your gynecologist, as there may be a reason as to why you can only use small tampons, especially after having children. If you’re concerned about the cup fitting inside of you, the best is to measure your cervix, look at our size guide and if you’re still unsure, chat to your doctor.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Which Menstrual Cup should I buy if I'm over 25, have had children, but have only been able to use medium tampons?</strong><br>
            If you’re concerned about the cup fitting inside of you, the best way to approach the situation is to measure your cervix, look at our size guide and if you’re still unsure, chat to your doctor. A cup is quite different to a tampon, so you may find that once you’ve measured your cervix, you’ll feel more reassured as to what size to go with.<br><br>
            
            <strong>I’ve just turned 25 - which cup should I buy?</strong><br>
            You can decide which BeYou cup to choose by measuring your cervix and using our size guide to decide which cup you should go for.
