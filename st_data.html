            "text": "Look, everyone has their preferences and that’s entirely up to you! Which is why you’ll find so many different options of period products available out there - we all have different needs and priorities when it comes to our comfort! Depending on your reasoning about making the switch, you’ll find that the menstrual cup has some of the best advantages:<br><ul><li>A menstrual cup produces less waste and is more environmentally friendly</li><li>Your BeYou cup is reusable and will save you loads of money in the long-term</li><li>Menstrual cups don’t contain toxic chemicals that affect your pH balance</li></ul><br>If you’re an avid-pad user then you know all about the fear of leaks and stains when your pad is feeling that slight-bit too full in a dire situation! By switching to a menstrual cup you’ll be saying goodbye to those terrible irritations of a pad and chafing from those wings! With your BeYou Menstrual Cup you can finally wear those sleek thongs at any time you want(although, you’re still more likely to find us on the couch, munching on chocolate)<br><br>Menstrual cups are extremely discreet and comfortable. You’ll find that because they’re inserted inside of you they’re less likely to shift or leak, thanks to the tight suction seal formed by the rim! You can wear a BeYou Menstrual Cup for up to 12 hours at a time, depending on how heavy your cycle is and what day of your flow you’re on. It is advisable to empty your cup every 4 hours, even if you can keep it in for a maximum of 12 hours - it’s always good to check in on your flow, as you never really know sometimes!<br><br>A menstrual cup won’t give off a strange smell, like the strong odours you get from a menstrual pad. This is just because the blood inside a menstrual cup isn’t exposed to as much air as it is on a pad."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Although a menstrual cup and tampon are inserted in a similar way, they way they both function is very different.<br><br>A tampon absorbs the liquid within your vagina, whereas the BeYou Menstrual Cup collects and holds the fluid, until you remove the cup. That’s why a menstrual cup is less likely to leak. Unlike a tampon, the BeYou cup is made from a super soft medical-grade silicone which protects the natural pH balance that won’t lead to vaginal dryness and doesn’t contain any toxic chemicals that could harm your body!<br><br>Because a tampon holds the moisture that is kept exposed within your vagina, you need to change your tampon every 4 hours maximum to avoid infection or irritation. With the suction seal formed with your cup, it’s safe to wear for up to 12 hours and holds more fluid than a tampon(Also why you’re less likely to leak!)<br><br>When it comes to environmental factors, you’ll know that tampons aren't recyclable for sanitary reasons, nor are they reusable either. Non-recyclable period products have a drastic effect on the environment. It may not be quite clear why at first, but think about how much waste that is when there are over  800 million women on their period at the same time, at any given day of the year. Think of just how much waste and pollution is saved(as well as money) when you can use one menstrual cup for a period of 10 years at a time!<br><br>Should you end up making a switch to the BeYou cup, you’ll probably find yourself asking why you haven’t done it sooner!"

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "You don’t need to be a certain age to use any type of period products, and this is certainly the same for menstrual cups. No matter what age you are, the moment you start menstruating you will want to find the most comfortable and suitable period product for you.<br><br>Just like if you had to start with any other menstrual product, it might take some practice and self-exploring. After all, using a tampon for the first time definitely doesn’t come as second-nature, the first few times.<br><br>It’s the same as with any person on their period, no matter your age. It’s just about finding the position and fit favourable for you. So many women using a menstrual cup come back to us and tell us how much better they’ve gotten to know themselves and their bodies, and that is never a bad thing, no matter what age you start using a menstrual cup!<br><br>My advice would be: give yourself time to try different folds and positions and get used to the menstrual cup, just like you would do with a tampon or a sanitary pad. Your blood will help make inserting a period product smoother and gentler, so go ahead and make a ‘bloody mess’! It’s the one time you’ll want to!"

And no matter how pretty your BeYou Menstrual Cup may look and feel, that little voice in the back of your head will definitely pop up and say ‘Oh hell no! No way is that going to go in and come back out again!'<br><br>You may have heard this somewhere before, but size doesn’t matter. Although they are bigger than a tampon, it’s much the same! Just like with a tampon, sanitary pad or any other menstrual product - there’s a bit of practice that first goes into it.<br><br>Remember that your vagina is able to move, expand, and bend. It’s one of many incredible features in our anatomy! With the right position, fit and how you insert your menstrual cup, it shouldn’t hurt.<br><br>You can feel a bit of discomfort at first if you haven’t found the right technique yet, but this will only point you in the right direction of discovering what does work better for you.<br><br>We’ve got all of the tips and tricks to a menstrual cup under the sun available for you, each having been tried and tested.<br><br>Before we get into that, you’ll need to know that every fold, position and fit is entirely dependent on your anatomy! Drop, squat, or raise a leg - you’re bound to find that ‘aha’ moment, the more you practice and overcome the block of putting a cup inside of your vagina.<br><br>We can promise you that there probably isn’t a single question we haven’t seen before!
